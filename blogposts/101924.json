    "text": "hello world. this is the first blog post that i am writing for this website, but i don't really have any ideas on what to write. i had some lo mein today for dinner, and even though my mom told me that it was 'spicy, just how [i] like it', it ended up being only a little spicy. it wasn't even really the kind of spice that you would expect when the word spicy is brought up. it was more like, tangy? but not in a perjorative way. it was interesting. that's all i can really say about today, because today was very uneventful. tomorrow i will write my national honors society essay and study for my calculus test, so that will be a far more eventful today. sam out."
